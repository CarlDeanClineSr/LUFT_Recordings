# LUFT_Recordings
Recordings For LUFT of Radio Spectrums (New Instrument) Dr. Cline invention  
# LUFT Field Audio Recordings

This repository contains short, well-documented audio recordings (.wav) and session logs from the LUFT Helix Reflector Mark I antenna and related experiments. The focus is on natural radio events (lightning, sferics, atmospheric, and celestial signals), captured and documented for scientific study and collaboration.

## üì° Equipment and Setup

- **Antenna:** LUFT Helix Reflector Mark I (see main LUFT repo for build details)
- **Receiver:** July 14th 2025 update: NESDR SMArt v5 and Wideband LNA 50MHz-4GHz SPF5189z
-  RTL-SDR BLOG A Balun One Nine nooelec and connectors for dish.
 ---
- **Software:**
  - HDSDR v2.81 (main SDR/audio capture and spectrum analysis)
  - Audacity (for audio viewing and editing)
  - Multi-Spectrum Lab (MSLab) and other analysis tools
- **Recording Modes:** Typically USB or AM, with spectrum windows and waveforms saved

---

## üóÇÔ∏è File Organization

- All recordings are in this `LUFT recordings'folder or subfolders by date/session
- Filenames indicate date, frequency, and event type, e.g.:
  - `2025-06-16_StormLightning_7468kHz.wav`
  - `2025-06-17_NightScan_4hr.wav`
  - `2025-06-17_SfericsSweep_333kHz.wav`
- Each recording has a matching `.md` or `.txt` log with notes on setup, conditions, and key events

## üìù Log 

```
# 2025-06-16 Storm Lightning Session's and updates as they happen
- Time: 11:55 PM CST
- Frequency: 7,468 kHz (USB)
- Equipment: LUFT Helix, ATS-25 Max, HDSDR v2.81
- Notes: Several strong sferics, band scan, heard distant voices (suspected 30m band from China), lightning times logged.
```

## üî¨ Analysis & Use

- **Spectral Analysis:** Use HDSDR, Audacity, Python (FFT), or Multi-Spectrum Lab
- **Research Focus:** Lightning sferics, HF propagation, atmospheric/celestial signals
- **Collaboration:** Data is public‚Äîcollaborators may analyze and publish findings with attribution

## üì§ Large Files

- Most files are <100 MB for GitHub compatibility   
- Long sessions or full datasets may be hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), or other platforms (see links/files as available)
